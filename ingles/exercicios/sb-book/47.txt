        - yes, JovemNerd is a famous website here in Brazil. It has two founders, Alexandre and deive.
        They started the website working at night after their normal work. At somepoint, they needed
        to live together at the same house with their family. Its funny, because they are married with
        sisters.
        Now days they have the biggest brazilian podcast and probally one of biggests of the world.
        It was great to follow them getting successful.
