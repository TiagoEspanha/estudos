How about staying in contact with nature and still have all the modern comforts? This house is the one for you! Place in the beautiful south of Minas Gerais, far away from big city problems, but with all technology you will need, like internet and cable tv!

The kitchen is really wide and it contains two ovens, an electric one and a wood oven for special meals. The living room has a table for 10, a nice tv and a fireplace for cozy nights! For a more private space, there are two rooms with bunk beds and two rooms for couples and two bathrooms, where you can use gas for hot water or turn on the wood oven to warm up the water.

There is a river right next to the house where you can swing in clean water, vast fields to ride a horse or play sports. Want a place to relax? How about the steam room with an incredible river view? We have it! There are a lot of walking trails that end on a waterfall.
There is a small city about 15 minutes away, where you can get a nice homemade food in several restaurants.

This house is perfect for anyone that wants to relax far from big cities!
