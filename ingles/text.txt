    So I was ten or twelve at the time. Me and my family were going to Fragaria, witch is a really small
town from Minas Gerais in the middle of nowhere, to spend the holliday there. It's a six or seven hour journey,
and the last two hours are on a really old dirt road.
    We were almost there, when the car got stuck. The car was a Pointer, very low car, really bad for
dirty roads. So, we need to go get some wood and leaves to use it to get us free. As a young carioca,
i was used to closing the window when I leave the car. So I did this, and i was the last person leaving
the car. But my father left the keys inside the car, so after we got the things to help us, no one could
enter the car.
    At the end, my father left his window a little open, so he got inside the car. He was really mad
at me, but all went well at the end of the day
